    <h1>Cold Brew Coffee</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Cold brew coffee is by no means created by the McCarty family, but this
      recipe is used almost daily by us. Cold brew has a higher caffiene content
      due to the nature of the longer brewing duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, the McCarty family adopted this brewing process into our lives.
